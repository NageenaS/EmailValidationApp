# EmailValidationApp

This Email Validation App is a simple web-based tool built with Flask that allows users to validate email addresses. It uses the AbstractAPI email validation service to check the validity of an email and returns various attributes such as deliverability, format validity, and other parameters.

## Features

- Validates the format, quality, and deliverability of an email address.
- Detects if the email is from a free provider, a disposable service, or if it is role-based.
- Provides an auto-correction suggestion for common typos in email addresses.

## Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository that allows users to store, share, and manage Docker images. The StockApp is also available on Docker Hub. 
You can find the image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/nageenashaik/emailvalidation) (replace with your actual Docker Hub link). This allows you to easily deploy the application without building the image locally.
